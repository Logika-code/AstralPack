## 🌟 AstralPack — Optimization and Convenience!
AstralPack is a modpack that lets you play with good FPS, and you can even try enabling shaders.
In this modpack, I:
- Made an effort to include **optimization mods** ✅
- Added a **pleasant design** to make it more convenient for everyone 🎨

💡 Some things may not be perfect yet, but I’m **still learning to create modpacks**, and for the early stages, this result already means a lot!
**_Thank you to everyone who downloaded and is playing it! 🙏_**

## ⚙️ Minimum Requirements
For stable gameplay, **4 GB of RAM** will be enough.

## 🔄 Updates Almost Every Day!
I really enjoy working on this modpack and am ready to release updates:
- Almost **every day**! 📅
- As long as the mods themselves keep getting updated 🛠️
I’m full of energy and inspiration to **create something useful** 💪. I want people to play with stable FPS, so I’ll continue releasing updates until the very end! 🚀

## 📜 Mod List Coming Soon!
The list of mods will be available a bit later because:
- I support **multiple game versions** 🎮
- It takes time to compile tables and transfer them to the website ⌛

⏳**Within a week, you’ll see a nice table** with all the mods used! 🗂️
